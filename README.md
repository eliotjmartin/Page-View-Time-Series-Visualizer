# Page-View-Time-Series-Visualizer
freeCodeCamp project - eliotm@uoregon.edu

In this project I visualized the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03 by creating a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. In doing so, I discovered yearly and monthly growth trends as well as other patterns in the number of page visits. I used Pandas, matplotlib and seaborn to achieve this.
