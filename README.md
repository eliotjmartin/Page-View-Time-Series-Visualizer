# Page-View-Time-Series-Visualizer
freeCodeCamp project - eliotm@uoregon.edu

In this project I visualized time series data by creating a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. In doing so, I discovered yearly and monthly growth trends as well as other patterns in the number of visits. I used Pandas, matplotlib and seaborn to achieve this.
